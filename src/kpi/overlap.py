"""KPI 2 - Overlap Rate. How often frequency layers collide.

The overlap rule is CO-BAND: within one band, the strongest transmitter serves
and the other transmitters on that same band are its neighbours; the counts are
then summed across bands. Two carriers of one cell are therefore never
neighbours of each other.
